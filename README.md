# API Integration Tests with Robot Framework

This is a minimal project for testing the RobotFramework in action runnint integration tests on a simple API.

To run this tests one needs to clone my github repo with the `Flask Finances API`, which is the API under test here. You can find the repo with the code here: https://github.com/8bitbeard/flask_finances_api.

After setting up the environment and running the API, you can run the tests here with the command `robot --outputdir results TestCases/`
